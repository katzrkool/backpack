# MyBackpack Grade API/Site

Basically, a flask server/requests api that hits the mybackpack server, and returns the data in an easier to understand way.

Hopefully soon, I'll be able to get my hands on some real data, so I can build like a breakdown of every assignment score, instead of just averages.

If you attempt to use it, you'll probably get an error, as it's summer, and no data is available yet, but if you use the /test endpoint, you can see an example
